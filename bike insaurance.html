    <span class="class5">WHY BIKE INSURANCE IS NECESSARY?</span><br><br><br>
    <span class="class6">There are a range of situations where your bike insurance policy can protect your bike and you from avoidable expenses. In accordance with the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, it is compulsory for every bike owner in India to have at least a third-party bike insurance policy. But apart from that, a two-wheeler insurance policy can be beneficial in different situations as Follows</span><br><br>
    <div class="class7">
        <span class="class8">
            <h2>Cover against natural and man-made disasters</h2>
            <p>In the event of a natural disaster in your area, the financial plan of your two-wheeler insurance policy will cover your bike against damages caused by floods, lightning, cyclones, storms and other natural phenomena. Similarly, the bike insurance plan also protects your two-wheeler against damages caused by man-made acts of violence such as terrorism and vandalism.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="class8">
            <h2>Personal accident cover</h2>
            <p>While riding your bike, if an unfortunate road accident leaves you with major or minor injuries, your two wheeler insurance can cover all kinds of personal injuries you may have suffered. While the injury itself can be a cause of mental grief, the financial protection offered by the personal accident cover can considerably mitigate the inconvenience!</p>
        </span>
        <span class="class8">
            <h2>Protection from legal fines</h2>
            <p>It is illegal to ride your bike without a valid third-party two-wheeler insurance policy. You could attract hefty legal and traffic fines for not carrying a bike insurance policy along. Even within the city limits, it is advisable to always keep your two wheeler insurance policy with you to avoid the hassle of getting into trouble with the law.</p>

    </span>
    <span class="class12">
        <h2>Standalone Third-Party Bike Insurance Policy</h2>
        <p>Third-party two wheeler insurance is a legal necessity if you want to take your bike out on the roads. Our standalone third-party two-wheeler insurance policy will help you if, in the event of an accident, your vehicle ends up causing damage to a third-party vehicle or injuries to a third-party person. However, your bike cannot receive the same protection under this policy. Damages to the bike and theft of the bike are not covered under a third party policy.</p>
